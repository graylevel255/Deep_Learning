# Deep_Learning

This repository contains all the codes implemented in the CS7015 Deep Learning Course offered at IIT Madras.

# Tasks explored 

1) Back-propagation in Deep Neural Networks (for function approximation, single label classification and multi-label classification)
2) AutoEncoders for Denoising, Pretraining of networks
3) Restricted Boltzman Machines
4) Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification
5) Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Annotation or Image Tagging
6) Image Captioning (beam search approach using the code base of the following repository : https://github.com/mlberkeley/oreilly-captions)
